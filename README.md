# Solar-burst-detection-using-CLIP
This project applies OpenAIâ€™s CLIP model (ViT-B/32) to classify solar radio bursts from astronomical FITS and PNG images. It includes data scraping, preprocessing (noise removal, format conversion), and deep learning-based classification of frequency-time plots.
